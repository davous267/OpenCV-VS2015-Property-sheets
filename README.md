# OpenCV 3.3.0 Visual Studio 2015 Property sheets – Debug & Release

Some basic property sheets to make OpenCV (3.3.0) work with Visual Studio. 
Quite basic sheets but still save some time.
  
If you want to use these sheets, you should have OpenCV libraries correctly configured.  
I recommend official tutorial – the [first one](http://docs.opencv.org/master/d3/d52/tutorial_windows_install.html) (FYI: using the pre-built libraries is probably a better choice) and the [second one](http://docs.opencv.org/master/d6/d8a/tutorial_windows_visual_studio_Opencv.html). The latter might be skipped if you know how to work with property sheets & have some OpenCV sample code.
